# Week 11 Notes

Classes as containers/namespaces

- namespace: organizes code to avoid name conflicts, code in two different namespaces
  can use the same name for a class or function
- Java uses modules, packages, and classes to create namespaces
- package example: `java.lang` frequently used or essential classes that most Java
  programs might want access to, imported on demand automatically in all java programs
- classes that act as namespaces for static functions: `Math` and `IO` are just containers
  for functions, while `String` and `Integer` contain static functions and represent a type of
  object
- static functions in the above classes: `abs`, `min`, `println`, `readln`, `format`, `parseInt`

Classes as types

- class: defines a type of object
- instance: an object created based on a class
