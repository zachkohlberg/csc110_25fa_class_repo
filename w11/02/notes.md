# Week 11 Notes

- namespace: organizes code to avoid name conflicts, can reuse the same
  name in different namespaces
- Java uses modules, packages, and classes as namespaces
    - example package: `java.lang` contains classes like `Math` and `String`,
      stuff that's commonly used in Java programs; these are all imported
      automatically by the compiler if your code uses them
    - example classes that act as namespaces: `Math`, `String`, `Integer`, `IO`
    - example static functions from these classes: `abs`, `min`, `format`,
      `parseInt`, `println`
