# Week 8 Notes

## Misc

- Grading mistake fixed
- Java 24 issue: allows println with no IO., error in Java 25 and in autograder
- VS Code and AI plugins
    - Submitting code generated by VS Code's AI plugins is cheating
    - VS Code not supported, but if you choose to use it you are responsible
      for configuring it, knowing which plugins you've enabled, and not using AI
      plugins
    - As always, I recommend just using Geany
- Midterm grades
- Assignments and deadlines

## Floating-Point Comparisons

- floating point numbers have a margin of error
- calculated floats/doubles shouldn't be checked for exact equality
- instead, we check for approximate equality:
  - find the difference between the two values
  - check whether the absolute value of the difference is less than some margin
    of error

## Random Numbers

- most random numbers on computers aren't actually random, they're pseudo-random
- pseudo-random number generators (pRNGs) start with a seed value, do some math to it,
  and return the result whenever you ask for a new random number
- using the same seed value with the same algorithm results in the same sequence of numbers

in Java, we can generate random numbers with `Math.random()`

- generates a random double from 0.0 (inclusive) to 1.0 (exclusive)
- to generate some arbitrary range of consecutive integers:
  - scale: multiply by the number of outcomes you want (how big is your range of numbers?)
  - truncate: cast to an int
  - offset: add the lower bound of your target range

## Boolean Logic

- OR: ||, inclusive or, true when at least one operand is true
- XOR: ^, exclusive or, true when exactly one operand is true
- order of operations: && is always evaluated before ||, just like multiplication before
  addition, so use parenthesis to make intended order clear when mixing && and ||
- short-circuiting: && and || will skip their second operand when it's not needed to
  evaluate the expression

## Characters

- chars are numbers, can implicitly convert to int
- can cast back to char with `(char)`
- letters and digits are encoded as sequential numbers
- can get individual characters from a string with the `.charAt(index)` method
