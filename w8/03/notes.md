# Week 8 Notes

## Misc

- Grading mistake fixed
- Java 24 issue
- VS Code and AI plugins
    - Submitting code generated by VS Code's AI plugins is cheating
    - VS Code not supported, but if you choose to use it you are responsible
      for configuring it, knowing which plugins you've enabled, and not using AI
      plugins
    - As always, I recommend just using Geany
- Midterm grades
- Assignments and deadlines

## Floating-Point Comparisons

- any floating-point calculation has a margin of error and may be slightly off
- comparing for exact equality is therefore unreliable
- instead, compare for approximate equality:
  - take the absolute value of the difference between your numbers
  - check whether it's less than some margin of error

## Random Numbers

- random numbers usually aren't random, they're pseudorandom!
- pseudorandom number generators (pRNGs) take a seed value, do some math, and give
  you the result
- same seed and same algorithm = same sequence of "random" numbers

`Math.random()` function:

- generates a random double from 0.0 (inclusive) to 1.0 (exclusive)
- to generate integers within an arbitrary range:
  - scale: multiply by the size of the range
  - truncate: cast to int
  - offset: subtract the low end of the range

## Boolean Logic

- OR: ||, inclusive or, true if at least one operand is true
- XOR: ^, exclusive or, true if exactly one operand is true
- order of operations: && evaluated before ||, just like * is evaluated before +
- recommendation: always use parenthesis to make intended order explicit when mixing && and ||
- short-circuiting: && and || will skip evaluating the right operand when the left is enough
