# Week 8 Notes

## Misc

- Grading mistake fixed
- VS Code and AI plugins
    - Submitting code generated by VS Code's AI plugins is cheating
    - VS Code not supported, but if you choose to use it you are responsible
      for configuring it, knowing which plugins you've enabled, and not using AI
      plugins
    - As always, I recommend just using Geany
- Midterm grades
- Assignments and deadlines

## Floating-Point Comparisons

- comparing the result of a floating-point calculation for exact equality
  is unreliable because floats are imprecise
- instead, check whether the absolute value of the difference is within some
  margin of error (check for approximate equality)

## Random Numbers

- random numbers often aren't really random, they're pseudo-random
- start with a "seed" value and manipulate it to create a new value every time
  you generate a random number
- starting with the same seed always gives the same "random" sequence

The function `Math.random()` generates a double from 0.0 (inclusive) to 1.0 (exclusive).
To generate random int values, you scale, truncate, and offset this number:

- Scale by multiplying by the number of possible outcomes you want. If we want ten
  different outcomes, then we write `Math.random() * 10`
- Truncate by casting to an int: `(int)(Math.random() * 10)`, remember parenthesis for
  the correct order of operations, results in a number from 0 to scale-1
- Offset by adding a number. If we want 1 to 10 instead of 0 to 9, then we can add 1:
  `(int)(Math.random() * 10) + 1`

## Boolean Logic

- OR vs XOR: OR is inclusive or, XOR is exclusive or
  - a OR b is true except when a == false and b == false
  - a XOR b is only true when a == false and b == true or a == true and b == false
  - XOR operator is ^, OR operator is ||
- && comes before || in order of operations, use parenthesis when mixing them to avoid mistakes
- short-circuiting: && and || won't evaluate their second operand when it's not necessary
  - If I asked you, what is FALSE && X? You can answer without knowing the value of X.
  - If I asked you, what is TRUE || X? You can answer without knowing the value of X.

## Characters

- char is an unsigned 16-bit int
- implicitly converts to int when you do arithmetic with it
- cast back to char with `(char)`
- letters and digits are encoded sequentially, allowing for fun tricks
- String's `charAt(index)` method gets a single char from a string
